# Task 14: Model Comparison & Best Model Selection

## Project Overview
This project compares multiple machine learning classification models on the same dataset.  
Each model is evaluated using performance metrics, and the best-performing model is selected and saved.

---

## Objective
- Train multiple classification models.
- Evaluate models using standard metrics.
- Compare performance in a table and chart.
- Select and save the best model.
